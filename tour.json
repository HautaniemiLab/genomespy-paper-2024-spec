This dataset has been compiled for \"Deciphering Cancer Genomes with GenomeSpy: A Grammar-Based Visualization Toolkit\" by Lavikka, et al. (2024).\n\n![Encoding](tour/encoding.svg)\n\nThis visualization displays segmented *copy-number* data and somatic *short variants* for multiple samples. Segments' colors encode copy-number LogR values. Heights of the gray, overlaying rectangles encode loss of heterozygosity, which is derived from B-allele frequency using the formula: LOH = abs(BAF − 0.5) × 2. Points represent somatic short variants (SNPs and indels). Their size encodes variant-allele frequency, and color encodes functional category. A tooltip reveals the exact values of all variables in the underlying dataset. Try to move your mouse cursor over the data!"

To zoom, use the mouse wheel or scroll the touchpad up/down using two fingers.\n\n![Using mouse or touchpad](tour/scroll-and-zoom.svg)\n\n**Semantic zooming**\n\nThe short variants have been scored using CADD ([Kircher et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.2892)). An approximately constant number of variants are visible at all zoom levels because their filtering threshold updates as you zoom in and out. This data set includes all variants that are pathogenic acording to ClinVar ([Landrum et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1153)) or that have CADD at least 10.0."

    "notes": "This view includes one representative sample (the one with the highest tumor purity) from each patient. A bird's eye view that shows all samples at the same time enables the perception of large-scale patterns in the data. To open a closeup view for closer inspection of individual samples, use a context menu (right mouse button) or the **E** key on the keyboard. Alternatively, you can filter the dataset by opening the context menu on the genomic or metadata panels.\n\nThe chromosome 17 plays an important role in HGSC, as it contains *TP53* and other tumor suppressor genes. Our data shows extensive LOH on chr17 (the gray overlay), indicating that all but a few patients have lost the other copy of the chromosome 17 in an early phase of the disease, likely through nondisjunction during anaphase. One of these outliers has multiple *TP53* mutations likely disabling both wild-type alleles an thus, enabling progression to HGSC despite retained heterozygosity. Diagnosis of the remaining outliers were changed into non-HGSC after a review by a histological pathologist.",
